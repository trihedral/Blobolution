# Blobolution

An environment programmed to train Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) through
simulated natural selection. Numerous objects with independent ANNs
interact with each other, competing for simulated limited resources

Wanna skip all the fancy stuff and just play with the simulation? Here's the 
link to the executable: https://github.com/trihedral/Blobolution/raw/master/out/artifacts/Blobolution_3_jar/Blobolution%203.jar
Just download and open it.
